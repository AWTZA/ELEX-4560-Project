\section{Introduction}

\par With our product, users can get alarm when the temperature, particular,
and moisture exceed the preset value. Users can set out product in their home, 
office, workshop and etc. to get info when accident fire, leakage and other unexpected 
even happen and get a stragate to reslove it. 

\section{Must Have}

	\subsection{Temperature Detection}
		\subsubsection{Description}
			\par Temperature detection is one of the main feature in our project, the sensor should 
			create a analog signal accroding to temperature. 
		\subsubsection{How to Test}
			\par Microcontroller must set a digital-high on a pin when temperature exceed a preset value. 

	\subsection{Particular Detection}
		\subsubsection{Description}
			\par Particular detection is one of the main feature in our project, the sensor should 
			create a analog signal accroding to particular. 
		\subsubsection{How to Test}
			\par Microcontroller must set a digital-high on a pin when particular exceed a preset value. 

	\subsection{Moisture Detection}
		\subsubsection{Description}
			\par Moisture detection is one of the main feature in our project, the sensor should 
				create a analog signal accroding to moisture. 
		\subsubsection{How to Test}
			\par Microcontroller must set a digital-high on a pin when moisture exceed a preset value. 

	\subsection{XBee Wirless Transmission}
		\subsubsection{Description}
			\par Wireles transmission is an improtant role in out project design. By using the wireless 
			transmission design, user can git rid of the annoying wire and has more fixbility to place the sensors. 
		\subsubsection{How to Test}
			\par When the microcontroller transimit a digital-high, XBee should able to create a wireless singal 
			on the sensor side and transimit it to the server side. 
	
	\subsection{Alarm System}
		\subsubsection{Description}
			\par Alarm system is the part that commnicate between human and machine. User should be able know the 
			status about the place where the sensor are. 
		\subsubsection{How to Test}
			\par When any of the sensor trigger a digital-high, the Respberry should able to trigger a alarm to user. 
			(e.g. flashing light, beep)

	\subsection{Long-duration Operating}
		\subsubsection{Description}
			\par User may not confort when they need to pay attention to device frequently especially change battery. 
			Our product should run at a long time without any manufacture. 
		\subsubsection{How to Test}
			\par Our product should be able to run at least two weeks without change battery(measured by power usage and battery capacity)
			and a stability(less or equal than one error per two weeks)


\section{Nice to Have}
	\subsection{Enclosure}
		\subsubsection{Description}
			\par It is nice to have an enclosure that printed by a 3d printer to fit all the parts. 
		\subsubsection{How to Test}
			\par A enclosure created by 3D printer. 

	\subsection{Water Proof}
		\subsubsection{Description}
			\par Our product shoud be able to work in any unexpected enviroment. Watere proof is a main factor to 
			cause eletronic failure. 
		\subsubsection{How to Test}
			\par Sensor can remain work when water fall from above. 

\section{Wishes}

	\subsection{Email Notice}
		\subsubsection{Description}
			\par User may not often stay around alarm system. It is nice to have email notice when they are away. 
		\subsubsection{How to Test}
			\par Recieve a email when alarm is tirggered. 


	\subsection{LCD Display}
		\subsubsection{Description}
			\par Having a human interface is not necessary but it is nice to have real time information. 
		\subsubsection{How to Test}
			\par Can diaplay real-time temp/particular/moisture parameter with a refresh rate of 10 sec. 


	\subsection{Status Bar}
		\subsubsection{Description}
			\par Device may disconnect from the server due the signal attenuation. Having a status bar could 
			notify user that device is working or not. 
		\subsubsection{How to Test}
			\par For any of the device goes offline, the relative LED should be off.
